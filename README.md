# Goweil LT Master
### **This is the house of *Goweil LT Master for Farming Simulator 2017*.**

The LT Master is a baler-wrapper combination wich can be process a great kind of material, not only mais chaff or grass; in the perspective of the game FS17, this machine can work on fields or in farm, and can process a wide variety of material greatly faster than a conventional baler and wrapper:

 - Chaff and grass can be pressed and wrapped for silage fermentation
 - Hay and straw can be pressed, and optional wrapped for weather protection
 - Woodchips can be pressed and wrapped for weather protection and for a better storage and handling, since LT Master can reduce the volume of tipical air dried woodchips.
 - Manure can also be pressed and wrapped for convenient storage and later use as fertilizer.
 - All wrapped bales have a greater value on the sell.
